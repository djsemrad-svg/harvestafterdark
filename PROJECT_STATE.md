# Harvest Afterdark: project state

Godot 4.7 (GDScript), renderer GL Compatibility, 480x270 pixel viewport scaled 3x.

## Status (Nov 12, 2026)

Phase 1 foundation ported from the earlier HTML prototype ("Quiet Fields") to Godot.
Automated tests: 63 / 63 pass (`godot --headless --path . res://tests/test_runner.tscn`).

Working: title screens, two modes (Survivor, Adventure), 3 save slots per mode, character creator,
homestead naming, clock and seasons, bed saves, hunger and thirst, bite rollback, tools and upgrades,
farming, general store, forge (geodes, refining, upgrades), trade crate, fishing minigame, mine floors 1-10,
infected with telegraphed lunges, four NPCs with schedules, gifts and quests, journal with nine tabs,
crafting and cooking, chests, backups.

## Code layout

- `scripts/autoload/balance.gd`: every tunable number.
- `scripts/autoload/data.gd`: all content (items, crops, fish, NPCs, quests, shops, buildings). Content lives in GDScript dictionaries instead of Resource files so it is easy to read and edit in one place.
- `scripts/autoload/art.gd`: procedural pixel art (tiles, objects, 16x32 characters, icons, buildings). Can be swapped for image files later.
- `scripts/autoload/game.gd`: game state and rules. `sfx.gd`: synthesized sound.
- `scripts/world/`: maps (`game_map.gd`, `map_builder.gd`), world actions (`world.gd`), drawing (`world_view.gd`), colour grade shader.
- `scripts/ui/`: interface (`ui.gd`) and theme helpers (`ui_kit.gd`).
- `tests/`: acceptance tests and a screenshot tool.

## Visual direction (agreed with Daniel)

- Stardew-like 16-bit look, adapted to a small community in an outbreak.
- Colour mood: warm and saturated in safe areas, greyer and colder in dangerous ones (mine, ridge, ruins). Done with a per-map grade (`GameMap.mood`).
- Infected: eerie but stylized. Pale grey-green skin, glowing eyes, torn clothes, hunched. No gore.
- Characters: 16x32, Stardew proportions. Done.
- Menus: lightly worn wood and parchment (nails, tape, scuffs). Done.
- Buildings have 5 conditions: 0 ruined, 1 abandoned, 2 weathered, 3 patched, 4 maintained. Done. Town is patched or maintained; farmhouse starts abandoned.
- Town has barricades at its entrances (sandbags, spiked logs). Done.
- Farmhouse shows visible repair stages: Hal's "Farmhouse repairs" service at the general store raises it one stage overnight. Done.
- Outskirts: overgrown and quiet (rusted wrecks, weeds through cracked road, toppled signs, suitcases). Started on the Ridge Path.

## Next steps

1. Polish found in screenshots: dialogue portrait crop (top of head cut off); area banner overlaps the clock panel (move it lower); HUD panels could be more compact.
2. Crafting expansion (decisions agreed):
   - Rework Stardew-style crafting categories (bombs, fences, sprinklers, artisan equipment, fertilizer, storage, lighting, refining, signs) into original, outbreak-flavoured items with new sprites.
   - Survival additions: tiered turrets, tiered fences and barriers (wood, stone, barbed wire, electrified), an ammo bench, and more.
   - Threat: night raids. Small groups of infected wander onto the farm some nights, growing as seasons pass.
   - Turret power: early turrets use crafted ammo; advanced turrets run on generators or solar.
   - Barriers take damage from the infected and are repaired with materials; damaged pieces show cracks and patches.
   - Gear look: mixed by tier. Low tiers homemade from scrap; top tiers restored military hardware.
   - Daniel shared the Stardew wiki Crafting and Cooking pages as reference.
3. Later phases from the master prompt (animals, residents, factions, hostile settlements).
